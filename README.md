Our application allows users to learn more about their favorite beers, or find new beers that they would enjoy. Once the user types in the beer that they are wanting to know more about, our application will pull up the information, the type of glass it should be enjoyed in, and 3 recipes that pair well with the specific type of beer. If the user doesn’t have a beer, or doesn’t know what type of beer they would like, there are nine buttons of highly rated beers that will give them the respective information.
